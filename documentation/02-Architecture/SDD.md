# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Purpose

This System Design Document (SDD) translates the approved CampusOS Software Requirements Specification (SRS v2.0) into a concrete, implementable technical architecture. It specifies every architectural decision, component boundary, data model, integration contract, event flow, deployment topology, and operational concern required to build CampusOS from source.

This document is the authoritative engineering reference. It is written for two audiences:

1. **Human engineers** (20+ senior/staff engineers across frontend, backend, mobile, infrastructure, and AI teams).
2. **AI coding agents** (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GPT-based agents) that will generate implementation code from this specification.

Every section contains enough detail that implementation decisions are obvious. When multiple approaches exist, one is chosen and the rationale is documented.

## 1.2 Goals

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| API latency (p95) | Response time | < 300 ms |
| Search latency (p95) | Query time | < 500 ms |
| Availability (standard) | Uptime | ≥ 99.5% |
| Availability (enterprise) | Uptime | ≥ 99.9% |
| Concurrent exam sessions | Per branch | 500+ students |
| Tenant capacity | Organizations | 10,000+ |
| Branch capacity | Branches | 100,000+ |
| User capacity | Total users | 10M+ |
| Deployment frequency | Releases | Multiple per day |
| Recovery Point Objective | Data loss window | ≤ 1 hour |
| Recovery Time Objective | Restore time | ≤ 4 hours |

## 1.3 Architecture Overview

CampusOS is a **modular monolith** built with NestJS (Node.js/TypeScript) using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), API-First, and AI-First principles. The system is deployed as a single deployable unit with strict internal module boundaries that can be extracted into independent microservices when operational pressure justifies it.

**Core architectural decisions:**

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture style | Modular Monolith | Reduces operational complexity at launch; module boundaries enable future extraction |
| Backend framework | NestJS (TypeScript) | Strong DI, modular system, decorator-based, excellent TypeScript support, large ecosystem |
| Frontend framework | React + TypeScript | Component model, ecosystem, hiring pool, SSR capability via Next.js |
| Mobile framework | React Native | Code sharing with web, single team skill set, native performance |
| Desktop framework | Electron, two separate apps: customer-facing (wraps `apps/web`) and Platform Super Admin (separate `apps/admin-desktop`, own codebase and build/release pipeline) | Customer-facing desktop reuses the web codebase for zero extra cost; the Super Admin app is kept fully isolated (no shared bundle, no shared distribution channel) since it carries cross-tenant access — see SDD §3.2.3.2 and SRS 5.28 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16+ | JSONB, RLS, partitioning, mature, ACID, extensibility |
| Cache / Queue | Redis 7+ (with Redis Streams) | In-memory speed, pub/sub, streams for job queues, distributed locks |
| Object Storage | S3-compatible (AWS S3 / MinIO) | Industry standard, CDN integration, lifecycle policies |
| Search | OpenSearch 2.x | Fork of Elasticsearch, OSS, full-text search, aggregations, tenant-scoped |
| Event Bus | Internal EventEmitter + Redis Streams | In-process for monolith, Redis Streams for durability and replay |
| Media Processing | FFmpeg (containerized workers) | Open source, all codec support, horizontal scaling |
| AI Orchestration | Custom Gateway with LangChain.js | Provider abstraction, prompt management, RAG, tool calling |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Native GitHub integration, matrix builds, deployment workflows |
| Container Runtime | Docker + Docker Compose (dev) / Kubernetes (prod) | Standardized, portable, orchestrated |
| Monitoring | OpenTelemetry + Grafana + Loki + Tempo | Vendor-neutral observability, unified metrics/logs/traces |

## 1.4 Scalability Goals

The architecture supports three scaling phases:

**Phase 1 — Vertical Scaling (0–1,000 organizations)**
- Single application instance behind a load balancer
- Single PostgreSQL primary with one read replica
- Single Redis instance
- Single OpenSearch node
- Media workers: 2–4 containers

**Phase 2 — Horizontal Scaling (1,000–10,000 organizations)**
- Multiple application instances behind load balancer with sticky sessions disabled (stateless JWT)
- PostgreSQL primary + 2 read replicas with connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Redis Cluster (3 primaries, 3 replicas)
- OpenSearch cluster (3 data nodes, 2 dedicated masters)
- Media workers: auto-scaled pool (8–20 containers)
- CDN for all static assets and media

**Phase 3 — Microservice Extraction (10,000+ organizations)**
- Extract high-traffic bounded contexts (Assessment Engine, Media Pipeline, AI Gateway) into independent services
- Per-service databases where isolation justifies operational cost
- Kubernetes with HPA and cluster autoscaler
- Multi-region deployment for enterprise tier

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Deployment pipeline:**

1. Developer pushes to feature branch → GitHub Actions runs lint, type-check, unit tests
2. PR merged to `main` → GitHub Actions runs full test suite (unit + integration + E2E)
3. Tests pass → Docker image built, tagged with commit SHA, pushed to container registry
4. Staging auto-deploy → Smoke tests run against staging
5. Manual approval gate → Blue/Green deployment to production
6. Health checks pass → Traffic shifted to new version
7. Rollback: automatic if health checks fail within 5 minutes; manual via Argo Rollouts

**Dependency rules:**

1. **Core modules** have zero dependencies on Academic, Business, or Platform modules.
2. **Academic modules** depend on Core and Platform modules, never on Business modules.
3. **Business modules** depend on Core and Platform modules. They may reference Academic modules read-only via events.
4. **Platform modules** depend only on Core modules. They expose interfaces consumed by all layers.
5. **All inter-module communication** crosses module boundaries via published interfaces (service contracts) or events, never via direct repository access.

## 2.4 Module Boundaries

Each module is a NestJS module with the following boundary rules:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MODULE BOUNDARY CONTRACT                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  ALLOWED ACROSS BOUNDARIES:                                 │
│  ✓ Injecting exported services from other modules           │
│  ✓ Consuming events published by other modules              │
│  ✓ Importing DTOs/interfaces from other modules             │
│  ✓ Calling public API methods on exported services          │
│                                                             │
│  PROHIBITED ACROSS BOUNDARIES:                              │
│  ✗ Importing repositories from other modules                │
│  ✗ Importing entities/ORM models from other modules         │
│  ✗ Direct database queries against other module's tables    │
│  ✗ Importing internal services (non-exported)               │
│  ✗ Circular dependencies between modules                    │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 2.5 Shared Services

The following services are shared infrastructure available to all modules:

### Event Bus

- **Technology:** NestJS EventEmitter (in-process) + Redis Streams (durable)
- **Pattern:** Events are published in-process for immediate subscribers and simultaneously written to Redis Streams for durable consumers (background jobs, analytics, webhooks)
- **Serialization:** JSON with schema version header
- **Ordering:** Per-stream ordering guaranteed by Redis Streams consumer groups

### Redis

- **Caching:** Application-level caching with configurable TTL per key pattern
- **Sessions:** JWT blacklist for token revocation
- **Rate limiting:** Sliding window counters per tenant and per user
- **Distributed locks:** Redlock algorithm for distributed mutex (exam submissions, grade finalization)
- **Job queues:** BullMQ backed by Redis for all background job processing
- **Pub/Sub:** Real-time event fanout for WebSocket notifications

### Object Storage (S3)

- **Buckets:** Separate buckets per content type (uploads, media, exports, certificates, temp)
- **Access:** Pre-signed URLs for direct client uploads and downloads
- **Lifecycle:** Automatic expiry for temp uploads (24 hours), archival for old media (90 days → Glacier)
- **Replication:** Cross-region replication for enterprise tier

### Search Engine (OpenSearch)

- **Indices:** One index per searchable entity type, tenant-scoped via field-level filtering
- **Sync:** Change Data Capture (CDC) from PostgreSQL via Debezium or application-level event handlers
- **Queries:** Full-text, autocomplete, faceted, filtered, boosted
- **Updates:** Near-real-time (< 5 second lag)

### Media Services

- **Transcoding:** FFmpeg workers consuming from BullMQ media queue
- **Thumbnails:** Auto-generated for videos and images on upload
- **Streaming:** HLS adaptive bitrate streaming for video content
- **CDN:** CloudFront distribution for all media assets

### Speech Services

- **Provider abstraction:** Adapter pattern wrapping Azure Speech, Google Cloud Speech, Deepgram, AssemblyAI
- **Routing:** Per-tenant provider configuration with fallback chain
- **Metering:** Usage tracking per tenant per provider for billing

### AI Orchestration

- **LLM Gateway:** Custom gateway abstracting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models
- **Prompt Management:** Versioned prompts stored in PostgreSQL, loaded at runtime
- **RAG Pipeline:** Embeddings stored in PostgreSQL pgvector, similarity search for context retrieval
- **Tool Calling:** Registered tools that LLMs can invoke (grade calculation, schedule lookup, content search)
- **Moderation:** Content safety filtering on all LLM inputs and outputs

#### 3.2.3.1 Frontend Theming & Customization Architecture

Per-organization frontend customization (SRS 5.26) is implemented as three tiers, all served from the **same shared codebase** (`apps/web`, `apps/mobile`) except Tier 3. This avoids per-tenant forks/deployments for the vast majority of customers while still allowing deep bespoke UI for large chain customers who pay for it.

**Tier 1 — Token Theming (all tiers, no redeploy):**
- `WhiteLabelConfig.tokens` stores a flat design-token map (colors, font family, logo/favicon URLs, custom domain) in `organizations.white_label_config` JSONB.
- On app boot, a `ThemeProvider` fetches the organization's token map (via `WhiteLabelConfigRepository`, Redis-cached) and injects it as CSS custom properties (`--color-primary`, `--font-body`, etc.) at the document root. `packages/ui` primitives consume these CSS variables exclusively — never hardcoded colors — so the same component library re-skins per tenant automatically.
- Mobile apps read the same token map via the API and apply it to a React Native theme context (React Navigation theme + component style props) plus app icon/splash asset swap at build-time per organization bundle identifier (or a single generic app + in-app organization selection for Starter/Growth tiers that don't warrant a dedicated app store listing).

**Tier 2 — Layout Variants (Pro/Chain and above, no redeploy):**
- A small, curated set of alternate layout components (e.g., `DashboardLayoutA`, `DashboardLayoutB`, alternate nav placements) ship in the shared codebase behind a `layout_variant` config key.
- Feature-flag-style resolution (`FeatureFlagService` pattern, §3.2.3) picks the active variant per organization/branch at render time. New variants require an engineering release (they're pre-built), but *assigning* a variant to an organization is a config change, not a deploy.

**Tier 3 — Custom Build (Enterprise, dedicated engagement):**
- For UI needs beyond Tiers 1–2, the customer gets a dedicated frontend deployment that imports `packages/ui`, `packages/sdk`, and `packages/shared` as versioned private npm packages, rather than forking the app source.
- This keeps the custom build receiving core component fixes/updates via normal package version bumps, while allowing arbitrary page composition, custom components, and layout beyond what config-driven Tiers 1–2 support.
- Explicitly **not** supported: arbitrary client-supplied code (JS/CSS) executed inside the shared multi-tenant app. Injecting tenant-authored code into a shared runtime is an XSS/security risk across tenants; Tier 3 exists specifically so bespoke needs get an isolated deployment instead.

**Data shape (`organizations.white_label_config` JSONB):**
```json
{
  "tier": "token" ,
  "tokens": {
    "colorPrimary": "#1A56DB",
    "colorSecondary": "#0F172A",
    "fontFamily": "Inter",
    "logoUrl": "https://cdn.../org123/logo.svg",
    "faviconUrl": "https://cdn.../org123/favicon.ico",
    "customDomain": "learn.orgname.com"
  },
  "layoutVariant": null,
  "customBuildRef": null
}
```

#### 3.2.3.2 Platform Super Admin Desktop Application (Isolated App)

Per SRS 5.28, the Platform Super Admin app is a **fully separate application**, not a role-gated view inside `apps/web`/`apps/desktop`. Isolation is enforced at every layer, not just the UI:

| Layer | Customer-facing apps | Super Admin app |
|---|---|---|
| Codebase | `apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `apps/desktop` | `apps/admin-desktop` (own repo path, own `package.json`, imports only `packages/shared` and `packages/sdk` — never `apps/web` code) |
| Build/release pipeline | Public CI/CD, deployed to CDN / app stores / customer-visible download page | Separate CI/CD pipeline, signed internal builds, distributed via internal channel only (e.g., internal artifact registry, MDM) — never linked from the marketing site or customer product |
| Auth | Standard login, any tenant role | Same `AUTH` module/endpoints, but the app's login flow only accepts tokens carrying the `platform_super_admin` role claim; any other valid token is rejected client-side *and* the corresponding API endpoints are additionally guarded server-side (defense in depth — never trust a client-side role check alone) |
| MFA | MFA required for privileged tenant roles per policy | MFA mandatory, no exceptions, shorter session TTL, no "remember this device" |
| API surface | Tenant-scoped endpoints only (`organization_id` derived from membership) | Cross-tenant platform endpoints (`/platform/v1/...`) — a distinct API namespace from tenant-scoped `/api/v1/...`, so the two are never accidentally reachable from the wrong app |
| Network exposure | Public internet | Recommended: additionally restricted by IP allowlist or VPN at the load balancer/WAF for the `/platform/v1/...` namespace |

This mirrors the Extraction Playbook pattern (§23.2) in spirit — clean interface boundary now, so the Super Admin backend surface could later be split into its own service without touching the tenant-facing product at all.


| `FeatureFlagToggled` | `{ organizationId, flag, enabled }` | All modules (cache invalidation) |

## 4.2 Auth Module Design

**Purpose:** Handles all authentication concerns including login, registration, token management, MFA, SSO, and session management.

**Responsibilities:**
- Authenticate users via email/password, phone, OAuth, SSO, LDAP, SAML
- Issue and refresh JWT access tokens and refresh tokens
- Manage MFA enrollment and verification
- Handle invitation flows
- Manage active sessions and provide session revocation
- Integrate with external identity providers

**Folder Structure:**

```

```

**Controllers:**

| Controller | Endpoints | Auth Required |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `AuthController` | `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout`, `POST /auth/password/reset`, `POST /auth/password/reset/confirm` | No (login/register), Yes (logout) |
| `MFAController` | `POST /auth/mfa/setup`, `POST /auth/mfa/verify`, `DELETE /auth/mfa` | Yes |
| `InvitationController` | `POST /auth/invitations`, `GET /auth/invitations/:token`, `PUT /auth/invitations/:token/accept` | Yes (create), No (accept) |
| `SessionController` | `GET /auth/sessions`, `DELETE /auth/sessions/:id`, `DELETE /auth/sessions` | Yes |
| `IdentityProviderController` | CRUD `/auth/identity-providers` | Yes (Org Admin) |

**Services:**

```typescript
// auth.service.ts — Core authentication logic
class AuthService {
  async login(dto: LoginDto): Promise<AuthResponseDto>
  async register(dto: RegisterDto): Promise<AuthResponseDto>
  async refreshToken(dto: RefreshTokenDto): Promise<AuthResponseDto>
  async logout(userId: string, sessionId: string): Promise<void>
  async resetPassword(dto: PasswordResetDto): Promise<void>
  async confirmPasswordReset(dto: PasswordResetConfirmDto): Promise<void>
}

// token.service.ts — JWT lifecycle
class TokenService {
  generateAccessToken(payload: JwtPayload): string
  generateRefreshToken(userId: string, deviceInfo: DeviceInfo): Promise<string>
  validateAccessToken(token: string): JwtPayload
  blacklistToken(token: string, expiry: number): Promise<void>
  isTokenBlacklisted(token: string): Promise<boolean>
}
```

**Cache Usage:**
- Token blacklist: `auth:blacklist:{tokenHash}` → TTL matches token expiry
- Active sessions: `auth:sessions:{userId}` → SET of session IDs, TTL 30 days
- Login attempt tracking: `auth:attempts:{ip}:{email}` → counter with TTL 15 min

**Background Jobs:**
- `SessionCleanupProcessor`: Runs daily, removes expired sessions from PostgreSQL
- `InvitationExpiryProcessor`: Runs hourly, marks expired invitations

**Public Interfaces (Exported):**
- `AuthService.validateAccessToken()` — used by auth guards across all modules
- `TokenService.generateAccessToken()` — used by identity provider integration

**Dependencies:**
- Redis (token blacklist, session cache, rate limiting)
- Notifications Module (invitation emails, MFA codes)

**Future Microservice Extraction Strategy:**
Auth is a strong extraction candidate. To extract:
1. Move Auth module to its own NestJS application
2. Replace direct database access with its own PostgreSQL database
3. Expose REST + gRPC endpoints for token validation
4. Other services validate tokens via JWT signature verification (no network call for access tokens) and call Auth service only for refresh and session operations
5. Use shared JWT signing keys stored in secret manager

## 4.3 LMS Module Design

**Purpose:** Core academic module managing the entire course hierarchy, content delivery, homework, and completion tracking.

**Responsibilities:**
- Full course hierarchy management (Subject → Program → Course → Module → Section → Lesson → Unit → Topic)
- 20+ content type support via extensible content block system
- Homework lifecycle (assignment, submission, grading, feedback)
- Prerequisite evaluation and content unlocking
- Completion tracking across all hierarchy levels
- Course templates and operations (clone, duplicate, export, import)
- Drag-and-drop reordering with position management

**Key Service Implementation — Prerequisite Evaluation:**

```typescript
// prerequisite.service.ts
class PrerequisiteService {
  /**
   * Evaluates whether a user has met all prerequisites for a given entity.
   * Called in real-time when student views course content.
   *
   * Prerequisite types:
   * - COMPLETION: Target entity must be completed
   * - MINIMUM_GRADE: Target entity must have >= threshold grade
   * - TIME_ELAPSED: Specified time must have passed since target completion
   * - DATE: Current date must be >= specified date
   * - MANUAL_UNLOCK: Teacher has manually unlocked for this student
   */
  async evaluatePrerequisites(
    userId: string,
    entityType: 'lesson' | 'module' | 'quiz' | 'exam',
    entityId: string,
  ): Promise<PrerequisiteResult> {
    const prerequisites = await this.prerequisiteRepo.findByTarget(entityType, entityId);

    const results = await Promise.all(
      prerequisites.map(prereq => this.evaluateSingle(userId, prereq))
    );

    return {
      unlocked: results.every(r => r.met),
      prerequisites: results,
    };
  }
}
```

**Key Service Implementation — Completion Tracking:**

```typescript
// completion.service.ts
class CompletionService {
  /**
   * Records completion and cascades upward.
   * Lesson completion → check Module completion → check Course completion.
   * Each level checks if ALL required children are complete.
   */
  async markLessonComplete(userId: string, lessonId: string): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Create completion record for lesson
    await this.completionRepo.create({ userId, entityType: 'lesson', entityId: lessonId });

    // 2. Publish event
    this.eventBus.emit(new LessonCompletedEvent({ userId, lessonId }));

    // 3. Check if module is now complete
    const lesson = await this.lessonRepo.findById(lessonId);
    const moduleComplete = await this.isModuleComplete(userId, lesson.moduleId);

    if (moduleComplete) {
      await this.markModuleComplete(userId, lesson.moduleId);
    }
  }
}
```

**Cache Usage:**
- Course list per branch: `lms:courses:{branchId}:list` → TTL 5 min
- Course detail: `lms:course:{courseId}` → TTL 10 min
- Prerequisite status: `lms:prereq:{userId}:{entityType}:{entityId}` → TTL 1 min (short, real-time critical)
- Completion progress: `lms:progress:{userId}:{courseId}` → TTL 2 min

**Background Jobs:**
- `HomeworkReminderProcessor`: Sends reminders for upcoming due dates (24h, 2h before)
- `HomeworkOverdueProcessor`: Marks overdue homework, triggers notifications and automation
- `CompletionRecalculationProcessor`: Bulk recalculates completion when curriculum changes
- `CourseCloneProcessor`: Handles large course cloning operations asynchronously

**Public Interfaces (Exported):**
- `CourseService.getCourse()` — used by Assessment, Gradebook, Analytics
- `EnrollmentService.getEnrollments()` — used by Groups, Analytics
- `CompletionService.getProgress()` — used by Gamification, Analytics
- `HomeworkService.getHomeworkByCourse()` — used by Gradebook

**Future Microservice Extraction Strategy:**
LMS is the largest module and a strong extraction candidate. To extract:
1. Move to independent NestJS service with its own database
2. Replicate user/branch data via events (eventually consistent)
3. Assessment and Gradebook communicate via events and lightweight REST calls
4. Content blocks with media reference Storage/Media services via URLs (already decoupled)
5. Search indexing continues via events → OpenSearch

**Auto-Grader Factory Pattern:**

```typescript
// grader.factory.ts
@Injectable()
class GraderFactory {
  private graders: Map<QuestionType, Grader> = new Map();

  constructor(
    multipleChoiceGrader: MultipleChoiceGrader,
    trueFalseGrader: TrueFalseGrader,
    matchingGrader: MatchingGrader,
    orderingGrader: OrderingGrader,
    fillBlankGrader: FillBlankGrader,
    numericGrader: NumericGrader,
    formulaGrader: FormulaGrader,
    codeSubmissionGrader: CodeSubmissionGrader,
  ) {
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.MULTIPLE_CHOICE, multipleChoiceGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.TRUE_FALSE, trueFalseGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.MATCHING, matchingGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.ORDERING, orderingGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.FILL_BLANK, fillBlankGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.NUMERIC, numericGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.FORMULA, formulaGrader);
    this.graders.set(QuestionType.CODE_SUBMISSION, codeSubmissionGrader);
  }

  getGrader(type: QuestionType): Grader {
    const grader = this.graders.get(type);
    if (!grader) throw new UnsupportedQuestionTypeError(type);
    return grader;
  }
}

// grader.interface.ts
interface Grader {
  grade(question: Question, response: QuizResponse): GradeResult;
}

interface GradeResult {
  score: number;
  maxScore: number;
  partialCredit: boolean;
  feedback?: string;
  details?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

**Anti-Cheat Sequence Diagram:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student as Student Browser
    participant API as Quiz Delivery API
    participant AC as Anti-Cheat Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant WS as WebSocket

    Student->>API: Start Quiz Attempt
    API->>DB: Create QuizAttempt (status: IN_PROGRESS)
    API->>AC: Initialize monitoring (anti-cheat level)
    API-->>Student: Attempt started + quiz config

    loop During exam
        Student->>API: Submit response for question N
        API->>DB: Save QuizResponse
        API-->>Student: Response saved

        Student->>API: Report anti-cheat event (tab switch)
        API->>AC: processViolation(attemptId, eventType)
        AC->>DB: Insert AntiCheatLog
        AC->>AC: Check violation threshold
        alt Threshold exceeded
            AC->>API: Force auto-submit
            API->>DB: Update attempt status = AUTO_SUBMITTED
            API->>WS: Notify student (exam ended)
        else Below threshold
            AC->>WS: Notify teacher (warning)
        end
    end

    Student->>API: Submit attempt
    API->>DB: Update attempt status = SUBMITTED
    API->>API: Trigger auto-grading (background job)
```

**Cache Usage:**
- Active quiz attempt: `assess:attempt:{attemptId}` → HASH with responses, TTL matches quiz time limit + 10 min buffer
- Question bank metadata: `assess:bank:{bankId}:meta` → TTL 10 min
- Anti-cheat violation count: `assess:violations:{attemptId}` → counter, TTL matches attempt

**Future Microservice Extraction Strategy:**
Assessment Engine is the second-strongest extraction candidate (after Auth). High traffic during exam periods with concurrent sessions. To extract:
1. Independent NestJS service with dedicated PostgreSQL
2. Question banks replicated independently
3. Grade results pushed to Gradebook via events
4. Anti-cheat monitoring via WebSocket on dedicated gateway
5. Auto-grading workers scale independently

**Grade Calculation Flow:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Grade Entry Created/Updated"] --> B["Load Category Weights"]
    B --> C["Load All Entries in Category"]
    C --> D["Calculate Category Average"]
    D --> E["Apply Category Weight"]
    E --> F["Sum Weighted Categories"]
    F --> G["Calculate Final Grade"]
    G --> H["Convert to Grade Scale"]
    H --> I["Store Running Total"]
    I --> J["Publish GradeRecorded Event"]

    subgraph Scale Conversion
        H --> H1{"Scale Type?"}
        H1 -->|Letter| H2["Map score range → letter"]
        H1 -->|GPA| H3["Map score → GPA points"]
        H1 -->|Pass/Fail| H4["Compare to threshold"]
        H1 -->|Custom| H5["Apply custom mapping"]
    end
```

**Cache Usage:**
- Grade summary per student-course: `gradebook:summary:{studentId}:{courseId}` → TTL 5 min, invalidated on grade change
- Grade scale mappings: `gradebook:scale:{scaleId}` → TTL 1 hour

**Future Microservice Extraction:** Lower priority. Extraction would follow Assessment module since they are tightly coupled. Communication via events (grade entries from assessment scores).

---

## 4.6 Remaining Module Designs

The following modules follow the same structural pattern defined in §4.1. Key differentiators are noted:

### Groups & Cohorts Module

```
src/modules/groups/
├── controllers/: group, cohort, enrollment-rule, bulk-operations
├── services/: group, cohort, enrollment-rule, bulk-operations, group-scoping
├── jobs/: bulk-enrollment.processor, auto-enrollment.processor
```
- **Key service:** `BulkOperationsService` — handles CSV import with streaming parser (csv-parse), validation, and batch insert via TypeORM bulk operations
- **Cache:** Group membership lists cached per user: `groups:user:{userId}:memberships` → TTL 5 min

### Collaboration Module

```
src/modules/collaboration/
├── controllers/: announcement, discussion, thread, post, qa, office-hours
├── services/: announcement, discussion, moderation, qa, office-hours, reaction
├── gateways/: collaboration.gateway.ts (WebSocket for real-time thread updates)
```
- **Key feature:** WebSocket gateway for real-time discussion updates using Socket.IO with Redis adapter for multi-instance support
- **Cache:** Pinned announcements: `collab:pinned:{courseId}` → TTL 10 min

### Attendance Module

```
src/modules/attendance/
├── controllers/: attendance, attendance-report
├── services/: attendance, attendance-report, attendance-alert
├── validators/: attendance-correction.validator (requires reason + approval)
```
- **Key constraint:** Records are immutable at the database level (no UPDATE on attendance_records). Corrections create new records linked to originals.
- **Cache:** Daily attendance status per class: `attend:daily:{classId}:{date}` → TTL 30 min

### Schedule & Calendar Module

```
src/modules/schedule/
├── controllers/: schedule, timetable, calendar-sync
├── services/: schedule, conflict-detection, calendar-sync, timetable
├── adapters/: google-calendar.adapter.ts, microsoft-calendar.adapter.ts
├── jobs/: calendar-sync.processor (bidirectional sync every 15 min)
```
- **Recurrence:** Uses RRULE (RFC 5545) format. Recurrences are expanded on-demand for display but stored as rules.
- **Conflict detection:** On every event create/update, queries for overlapping events on same room/teacher/student.

### Voice & Pronunciation Module

```
src/modules/voice/
├── controllers/: speech-recording, pronunciation, speaking-assignment, oral-exam
├── services/: speech-recording, pronunciation, speech-provider-gateway, speaking-assignment, speech-usage
├── adapters/: azure-speech.adapter.ts, google-speech.adapter.ts, deepgram.adapter.ts, assemblyai.adapter.ts
├── jobs/: pronunciation-scoring.processor, usage-aggregation.processor
```
- **Provider Gateway Pattern:** See §12 for full details
- **Immutability:** Assessment-mode recordings are stored with immutable flag in S3 (Object Lock)

### Gamification Module

```
src/modules/gamification/
├── controllers/: badge, achievement, xp, leaderboard, streak, challenge, certificate, reward
├── services/: badge, achievement, xp, point, leaderboard, streak, challenge, certificate, reward
├── jobs/: leaderboard-recalculation.processor, streak-check.processor, certificate-generation.processor
├── templates/: certificate templates (HTML/CSS)
```
- **Leaderboard recalculation:** Runs every 5 minutes via cron job. Uses Redis sorted sets for real-time ranking: `gamify:leaderboard:{scope}:{scopeId}`
- **Certificate generation:** Uses Puppeteer to render HTML template → PDF. QR code generated with `qrcode` npm package.

### CRM Module

```
src/modules/crm/
├── controllers/: lead, inquiry, follow-up, pipeline, conversion
├── services/: lead, inquiry, follow-up, pipeline, conversion
├── jobs/: follow-up-reminder.processor

src/modules/finance/
├── controllers/: revenue, accounts-receivable, usage-billing, financial-export
├── services/: revenue, accounts-receivable, usage-billing, financial-export, reconciliation
├── jobs/: usage-aggregation.processor, aging-calculation.processor
```

├── controllers/: invoice, payment, refund, credit, payment-schedule
├── services/: invoice, payment, payment-gateway, refund, credit, payment-schedule, payment-reminder
├── adapters/: stripe.adapter.ts, paypal.adapter.ts
├── jobs/: payment-reminder.processor, recurring-payment.processor
```
- **Gateway abstraction:** Adapter pattern identical to speech providers. See §17 for integration details.
- **Idempotency:** Payment operations use idempotency keys stored in Redis: `payment:idempotency:{key}` → TTL 24h

### Website Builder Module

# 5. Shared Infrastructure

## 5.1 Authentication Infrastructure

### JWT Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Server
    participant Redis
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Note over Client,DB: Login Flow
    Client->>API: POST /auth/login {email, password}
    API->>DB: Validate credentials
    DB-->>API: User record
    API->>API: Generate JWT access token (15 min expiry)
    API->>DB: Create refresh token record
    API->>Redis: Cache session info
    API-->>Client: {accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn}

    Note over Client,DB: Authenticated Request
    Client->>API: GET /api/v1/courses (Authorization: Bearer {accessToken})
    API->>API: Verify JWT signature (local, no DB call)
    API->>Redis: Check token blacklist
    Redis-->>API: Not blacklisted
    API->>API: Extract claims (userId, orgId, branchId, roles)
    API-->>Client: 200 OK + data

    Note over Client,DB: Token Refresh
    Client->>API: POST /auth/refresh {refreshToken}
    API->>DB: Validate refresh token (exists, not revoked, not expired)
    API->>API: Generate new access token
    API->>DB: Rotate refresh token (invalidate old, create new)
    API-->>Client: {accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn}
```

**JWT Payload Structure:**

```typescript
interface JwtPayload {
  sub: string;          // userId (UUID)
  orgId: string;        // organizationId (UUID)
  branchId: string;     // active branchId (UUID)
  roles: string[];      // ['teacher', 'branch_admin']
  permissions: string[];// ['course:create', 'grade:edit'] — cached subset
  iat: number;          // issued at
  exp: number;          // expiry (15 minutes from iat)
  jti: string;          // JWT ID for blacklisting
  mfa: boolean;         // MFA completed
  sessionId: string;    // session identifier
}
```

**Token Configuration:**

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Access token expiry | 15 minutes | Short-lived to limit damage from token theft |
| Refresh token expiry | 30 days | Convenient for mobile users, rotated on use |
| Refresh token rotation | Enabled | Each refresh invalidates the old token |
| Token algorithm | RS256 | Asymmetric keys allow verification without sharing signing key |
| Token blacklist TTL | Matches access token remaining TTL | Memory-efficient, expired tokens don't need blacklisting |

## 5.2 Authorization Infrastructure

### RBAC + ABAC Combined Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    REQ["Incoming Request"] --> AUTH_GUARD["Auth Guard: Verify JWT"]
    AUTH_GUARD --> RBAC_GUARD["RBAC Guard: Check Role Permissions"]
    RBAC_GUARD --> ABAC_GUARD["ABAC Guard: Evaluate Attribute Policies"]
    ABAC_GUARD --> TENANT_GUARD["Tenant Guard: Verify org_id/branch_id scope"]
    TENANT_GUARD --> FEATURE_GUARD["Feature Flag Guard: Check module access"]
    FEATURE_GUARD --> CONTROLLER["Controller Method"]

    RBAC_GUARD -->|"Denied"| DENY["403 Forbidden"]
    ABAC_GUARD -->|"Denied"| DENY
    TENANT_GUARD -->|"Denied"| DENY
    FEATURE_GUARD -->|"Disabled"| DENY_MODULE["403 Module Not Licensed"]
```

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Scope | Example Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Platform Admin | Global | `*:*` (all resources, all actions) |
| Organization Admin | Organization-wide | `organization:*`, `branch:*`, `user:*`, `course:*`, `finance:*` |
| Branch Admin | Single branch | `branch:read`, `branch:update`, `user:manage` (within branch), `course:*` |
| Teacher | Assigned classes/courses | `course:read`, `lesson:*`, `homework:*`, `grade:*`, `attendance:*` (within assignments) |
| Assistant Teacher | Configurable per org | Custom subset of teacher permissions defined by org admin |
| Student | Own data + enrolled courses | `course:read`, `homework:submit`, `quiz:attempt`, `profile:read` (own) |
| Parent | Linked children | `student:read` (linked children), `grade:read`, `attendance:read`, `message:send` |

### Guard Implementation

```typescript
// rbac.guard.ts
@Injectable()
export class RBACGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(
    private reflector: Reflector,
    private rbacService: RBACService,
    private cacheManager: CacheManager,
  ) {}

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const requiredPermissions = this.reflector.get<string[]>(
      'permissions',
      context.getHandler(),
    );
    if (!requiredPermissions?.length) return true;

    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user as JwtPayload;

    // Check cached permissions first
    const cacheKey = `rbac:${user.sub}:permissions`;
    let userPermissions = await this.cacheManager.get<string[]>(cacheKey);

    if (!userPermissions) {
      userPermissions = await this.rbacService.getUserPermissions(user.sub);
      await this.cacheManager.set(cacheKey, userPermissions, 300); // 5 min TTL
    }

    return requiredPermissions.every(p => userPermissions.includes(p) || userPermissions.includes('*:*'));
  }
}
```

## 5.3 Feature Flags

**Implementation:** Feature flags are stored in PostgreSQL per organization and cached in Redis with a 60-second TTL. The `FeatureFlagGuard` decorator checks module access before controller method execution.

**Flag Categories:**

| Category | Example Flags | Enforcement |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Module Access | `module:gamification`, `module:voice`, `module:crm`, `module:marketplace` | FeatureFlagGuard on controller |
| Feature Toggle | `feature:anti_cheat_proctored`, `feature:adaptive_quiz`, `feature:offline_mode` | Service-level check |
| Usage Limits | `limit:storage_gb`, `limit:sms_credits`, `limit:ai_tokens` | Usage tracking + enforcement |
| Rollout | `rollout:new_quiz_ui`, `rollout:ai_grading_assistant` | Percentage-based or org-list |

```typescript
// feature-flag.guard.ts
@Injectable()
export class FeatureFlagGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private featureFlagService: FeatureFlagService) {}

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const requiredFlags = this.reflector.get<string[]>('feature-flags', context.getHandler());
    if (!requiredFlags?.length) return true;

    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const orgId = request.user.orgId;

    const flagStates = await this.featureFlagService.evaluateFlags(orgId, requiredFlags);
    return requiredFlags.every(flag => flagStates[flag] === true);
  }
}

// Usage in controller
@Post()
@Permissions('course:create')
@FeatureFlags('module:lms')
async createCourse(@Body() dto: CreateCourseDto) { ... }
```

## 5.4 Audit Logs

**Architecture:**

- Audit logs are stored in the `audit` PostgreSQL schema
- The audit schema uses a dedicated database role with INSERT + SELECT only (no UPDATE/DELETE)
- An `AuditInterceptor` automatically logs all mutation operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Sensitive operations (grade changes, permission changes, data deletion) include before/after snapshots
- Audit logs are indexed by `organization_id`, `actor_id`, `resource_type`, and `timestamp`
- Retention: 7 years for financial/grade audits, 2 years for operational audits

**Audit Record Structure:**

```typescript
interface AuditRecord {
  id: string;                  // UUID
  organizationId: string;      // tenant scope
  actorId: string;             // user who performed the action
  actorRole: string;           // role at time of action
  action: string;              // 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE' | 'ACCESS' | 'LOGIN' | 'EXPORT'
  resourceType: string;        // 'grade' | 'user' | 'course' | 'quiz_attempt' etc.
  resourceId: string;          // ID of affected resource
  oldValue: Record<string, any> | null;  // previous state (for updates/deletes)
  newValue: Record<string, any> | null;  // new state (for creates/updates)
  metadata: Record<string, any>;         // additional context
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## 5.5 Notification Infrastructure

**Multi-Channel Dispatch Architecture:**

**Implementation:** Sliding window rate limiting using Redis.

**Rate Limit Tiers:**

| Endpoint Category | Rate Limit | Window | Key |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Authentication (login) | 10 requests | 15 min | `rl:auth:{ip}:{email}` |
| API (standard) | 100 requests | 1 min | `rl:api:{orgId}:{userId}` |
| API (heavy: export, import) | 5 requests | 1 min | `rl:api:heavy:{orgId}:{userId}` |
| File upload | 20 requests | 1 min | `rl:upload:{orgId}:{userId}` |
| Search | 30 requests | 1 min | `rl:search:{orgId}:{userId}` |
| AI endpoints | 20 requests | 1 min | `rl:ai:{orgId}:{userId}` |
| Webhook dispatch (per org) | 1000 events | 1 hour | `rl:webhook:{orgId}` |

**Response Headers:**

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1720972800
Retry-After: 30  (only on 429 responses)

# 6. Event Architecture

## 6.1 Event Bus Design

### Architecture Decision

**Choice:** Hybrid in-process EventEmitter + Redis Streams

**Rationale:**
- In-process EventEmitter provides zero-latency synchronous event handling within the monolith
- Redis Streams provide durability, replay capability, and consumer group support for background processing
- This combination avoids the operational overhead of a full message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ) while maintaining reliability
- When extracting microservices, Redis Streams naturally evolve into the inter-service communication layer

export abstract class DomainEvent {
  readonly eventId: string;          // UUID v4
  readonly eventType: string;        // 'student.created', 'homework.submitted'
  readonly aggregateId: string;      // ID of the aggregate that produced the event
  readonly aggregateType: string;    // 'Student', 'Homework'
  readonly organizationId: string;   // tenant scope
  readonly occurredAt: Date;         // event timestamp
  readonly version: number;          // schema version for backward compatibility
  readonly metadata: {
    correlationId: string;           // request trace ID
    causationId: string;             // ID of event that caused this event
    actorId: string;                 // user who triggered the action
  };

  constructor(partial: Partial<DomainEvent>) {
    this.eventId = partial.eventId ?? uuidv4();
    this.occurredAt = partial.occurredAt ?? new Date();
    this.version = partial.version ?? 1;
    Object.assign(this, partial);
  }

## 6.3 Retry Strategy

**Exponential Backoff Configuration:**

```typescript
// Retry delays: attempt 1 = 1s, attempt 2 = 4s, attempt 3 = 16s, attempt 4 = 64s, attempt 5 = 256s
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 5,           // critical events
  maxRetriesStandard: 3,   // non-critical events
  baseDelay: 1000,         // 1 second
  multiplier: 4,           // exponential factor
  maxDelay: 300000,        // 5 minutes max
  jitter: true,            // ±20% random jitter to prevent thundering herd
};
```

## 6.4 Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Behavior

**DLQ Buckets:**

| DLQ Name | Contents | Alert Threshold | Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `critical-dlq` | Grade records, enrollment changes, payment events | > 0 messages | Immediate PagerDuty alert + manual review |
| `notification-dlq` | Failed notifications | > 100 messages/hour | Alert to ops channel |
| `search-dlq` | Failed search index updates | > 500 messages/hour | Alert + auto-reindex job |
| `analytics-dlq` | Failed analytics events | > 1000 messages/hour | Alert, data may be stale |
| `audit-dlq` | Failed audit log writes | > 0 messages | High-priority alert (compliance risk) |
| `gamification-dlq` | Failed XP/badge awards | > 100 messages/hour | Alert, manual reconciliation |
| `webhook-dlq` | Failed webhook deliveries | > 50 messages/hour | Alert, webhook retry scheduled |

**DLQ Processing:**
1. Failed events land in DLQ after max retries exhausted
2. DLQ monitor checks queue depth every 60 seconds
3. Alerts triggered based on thresholds above
4. Ops team reviews DLQ via admin dashboard
5. Events can be replayed (reprocessed), acknowledged (discarded), or escalated

# 7. Database Architecture

## 7.1 Database Strategy

**Database Engine:** PostgreSQL 16+

**Key Features Used:**
- JSONB columns for flexible schema (content blocks, quiz config, automation rules)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- Table partitioning for high-volume tables (audit logs, analytics events)
- Partial indexes for common query patterns
- Generated columns for computed values
- Full-text search (GIN indexes) for in-database text search (supplementing OpenSearch)
- pgvector extension for AI embeddings

## 7.2 Schema Organization

```
PostgreSQL Database: campusos
├── public schema        — Core business tables
├── audit schema         — Immutable audit log tables
├── analytics schema     — Analytics aggregates and materialized views
├── search schema        — Full-text search materialized views
└── extensions
    ├── uuid-ossp        — UUID generation
    ├── pgcrypto         — Cryptographic functions
    ├── pg_trgm          — Trigram matching for fuzzy search
    └── vector           — pgvector for AI embeddings
```

## 7.3 Tenant Isolation via Row-Level Security

```sql
-- Enable RLS on tenant-scoped tables
ALTER TABLE courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can only see data from their organization
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON courses
  USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::uuid);

-- Set tenant context at the start of each request
-- This is done by the TenantMiddleware in NestJS
SET LOCAL app.current_organization_id = 'org-uuid-here';
SET LOCAL app.current_branch_id = 'branch-uuid-here';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

**Implementation in NestJS:**

```typescript
// tenant.middleware.ts
@Injectable()
export class TenantMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  constructor(private dataSource: DataSource) {}

  async use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const user = req.user as JwtPayload;
    if (!user) return next();

    const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();
    await queryRunner.query(`SET LOCAL app.current_organization_id = '${user.orgId}'`);
    await queryRunner.query(`SET LOCAL app.current_branch_id = '${user.branchId}'`);
    await queryRunner.query(`SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = '${user.sub}'`);

    req['queryRunner'] = queryRunner;
    next();
  }
}
```

## 7.4 Table Design Conventions

### Standard Columns

Every business table includes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  branch_id UUID REFERENCES branches(id),            -- NULL for org-wide records
  -- ... domain columns ...
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,                             -- soft delete
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  updated_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1                  -- optimistic locking
);

-- Standard indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_example_org_id ON example(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_example_branch_id ON example(branch_id) WHERE branch_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_example_created_at ON example(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_example_deleted_at ON example(deleted_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Soft Deletes

- All user-facing records use soft deletes (`deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`)
- Queries exclude soft-deleted records by default (TypeORM `@DeleteDateColumn`)
- Hard deletes allowed only for: temp uploads, expired sessions, DLQ entries
- Soft-deleted records are purged after retention period (configurable per entity type, default 90 days)

## 7.5 Core Tables

## 7.6 Partitioning Strategy

| Table | Partition Strategy | Partition Key | Partition Size |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| `audit.audit_logs` | Range | `created_at` | Monthly |
| `analytics_events` | Range | `created_at` | Monthly |
| `notification_deliveries` | Range | `created_at` | Monthly |
| `quiz_attempts` | Range | `created_at` | Quarterly |
| `webhook_deliveries` | Range | `created_at` | Monthly |
| `login_attempts` | Range | `created_at` | Monthly |

## 7.7 Indexing Strategy

**Standard indexes on every tenant-scoped table:**
- `(organization_id)` — tenant filtering
- `(branch_id)` WHERE branch_id IS NOT NULL — branch filtering
- `(created_at)` — time-based queries
- `(deleted_at)` WHERE deleted_at IS NULL — soft delete filtering

**Composite indexes for common query patterns:**
- `(organization_id, status)` — filtered lists
- `(organization_id, branch_id, status)` — branch-scoped lists
- `(user_id, entity_type)` on completion_records — progress queries
- `(student_id, course_id)` on gradebook_entries — student grades
- `(quiz_id, student_id)` on quiz_attempts — attempt history

**GIN indexes for JSONB and array columns:**
- `tags` array columns on courses, questions
- `data` JSONB on content_blocks (for type-specific queries)

## 7.8 Backup Strategy

| Component | Method | Frequency | Retention | Storage |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Full database backup | pg_dump / RDS automated | Daily at 02:00 UTC | 30 days | S3 (separate bucket, cross-region) |
| Incremental (WAL) | pg_basebackup + WAL archive | Continuous | 7 days | S3 |
| Point-in-time recovery | WAL replay | N/A (continuous) | 7-day window | WAL archive |
| Audit schema | Separate backup stream | Daily | 7 years | S3 Glacier |
| Test restore | Automated restore to staging | Weekly | N/A | Staging environment |

## 7.9 Search Indexing

OpenSearch indices are kept in sync via event-driven indexing:

1. Entity created/updated → Domain event published
2. Search event handler receives event → Constructs OpenSearch document
3. Document upserted to OpenSearch index

For bulk reindexing (schema changes, disaster recovery):
- Background job scans PostgreSQL tables in batches of 1,000
- Bulk indexes documents to OpenSearch
- Progress tracked via `reindex_jobs` table

# 8. API Architecture

## 8.1 REST Conventions

### URL Structure

```
{protocol}://{host}/api/v{version}/{resource}
```

**Examples:**

```
GET    /api/v1/courses                          # List courses
POST   /api/v1/courses                          # Create course
GET    /api/v1/courses/:id                      # Get course
PUT    /api/v1/courses/:id                      # Update course
DELETE /api/v1/courses/:id                      # Soft delete course
GET    /api/v1/courses/:id/modules              # List modules in course
POST   /api/v1/courses/:id/modules              # Create module in course
GET    /api/v1/courses/:id/enrollments          # List enrollments
POST   /api/v1/courses/:courseId/quizzes/:quizId/attempts  # Start quiz attempt
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Use plural nouns for resources: `/courses`, `/students`, `/quizzes`
- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/question-banks`, `/content-blocks`
- Nest resources max 2 levels deep: `/courses/:id/modules` (not `/courses/:id/modules/:id/lessons/:id/blocks`)
- Use query parameters for filtering, not URL segments

## 8.2 API Versioning

**Strategy:** URL-based versioning (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`)

**Rationale:** URL versioning is explicit, easy to route, and clear in documentation. Header-based versioning was rejected because it's harder to test in browsers and less obvious in logs.

**Version lifecycle:**
1. Current version (`v1`) receives all new features
2. When breaking changes are needed, `v2` is created
3. `v1` enters deprecation (6-month notice)
4. `v1` responses include `Deprecation` header
5. After deprecation period, `v1` returns 410 Gone

## 8.3 Authentication

Every API request (except login/register/public endpoints) must include:

```
Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}
```

**Tenant context** is derived entirely from the JWT token claims. The API never accepts `organization_id` or `branch_id` from request parameters for authorization purposes — only from the authenticated token.

## 8.4 Pagination

**Strategy:** Cursor-based pagination for lists, offset-based as fallback for admin queries.

**Cursor-based (default for all list endpoints):**

```json
// Request
GET /api/v1/courses?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6ImFiYzEyMyJ9

// Response
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "cursor": "eyJpZCI6ImFiYzEyMyJ9",
    "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6ImRlZjQ1NiJ9",
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

**Offset-based (admin/reporting endpoints only):**

```json
// Request
GET /api/v1/admin/users?page=3&pageSize=50

// Response
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 3,
    "pageSize": 50,
    "totalItems": 1250,
    "totalPages": 25
  }
}
```

**Default limit:** 20 items. **Max limit:** 100 items.

## 8.5 Sorting

```
GET /api/v1/courses?sort=createdAt:desc,title:asc
```

**Format:** `sort={field}:{direction}[,{field}:{direction}]`

**Allowed sort fields** are whitelisted per endpoint. Sorting on non-indexed columns is rejected with 400.

## 8.6 Filtering

```
GET /api/v1/courses?status=published&subject=mathematics&difficulty=beginner&createdAfter=2026-01-01
```

**Complex filters (search endpoints):**

```
GET /api/v1/search/courses?q=algebra&filters[subject]=math&filters[level]=intermediate&filters[format]=self_paced
```

## 8.7 Error Responses

**Standardized error envelope:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "title",
        "message": "Title is required",
        "code": "REQUIRED"
      },
      {
        "field": "dueDate",
        "message": "Due date must be in the future",
        "code": "FUTURE_DATE"
      }
    ],
    "requestId": "req-abc123",
    "timestamp": "2026-07-14T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error codes:**

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Request body validation failed |
| 400 | `BAD_REQUEST` | Malformed request |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Missing or invalid token |
| 401 | `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Access token expired |
| 401 | `MFA_REQUIRED` | MFA verification needed |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Insufficient permissions |
| 403 | `MODULE_NOT_LICENSED` | Organization doesn't have module access |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Resource not found |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` | Resource already exists or version conflict |
| 422 | `UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY` | Business logic validation failed |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many requests |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected server error |

## 8.8 Validation

**Library:** `class-validator` + `class-transformer` (NestJS built-in pipe)

**Validation pipe configuration:**

```typescript
// main.ts
app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({
  whitelist: true,           // Strip unknown properties
  forbidNonWhitelisted: true, // Throw error on unknown properties
  transform: true,           // Auto-transform payloads to DTO instances
  transformOptions: {
    enableImplicitConversion: true,
  },
}));
```

**DTO example:**

```typescript
// create-course.dto.ts
export class CreateCourseDto {
  @IsString()
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(500)
  title: string;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsString()
  @MaxLength(5000)
  description?: string;

  @IsEnum(CourseFormat)
  format: CourseFormat;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsUUID()
  subjectId?: string;

  @IsOptional()
  @IsArray()
  @IsString({ each: true })
  @MaxLength(50, { each: true })
  tags?: string[];
}
```

## 8.9 Idempotency

**Idempotency keys** are required for all state-changing operations that have side effects (payments, enrollments, grade entries).

```
POST /api/v1/payments
Idempotency-Key: idem-key-unique-12345
Content-Type: application/json

{ "invoiceId": "...", "amount": 500, "method": "card" }
```

**Implementation:**
1. Client generates a unique idempotency key (UUID recommended)
2. Server checks Redis: `idempotency:{key}` → if exists, return stored response
3. If not exists, process request, store response in Redis with 24h TTL
4. Return response with `Idempotency-Key` echoed in response header

## 8.10 Rate Limiting

See §5.11 for rate limit tiers and implementation.

## 8.11 OpenAPI / Swagger

- OpenAPI 3.0 spec generated from NestJS decorators (`@nestjs/swagger`)
- Swagger UI served at `/api/docs` (disabled in production, available in staging)
- API schema exported as `openapi.json` for client SDK generation
- All DTOs documented with `@ApiProperty()` decorators including descriptions, examples, and constraints

```typescript
// Example controller with OpenAPI decorators
@ApiTags('courses')
@ApiSecurity('bearer')
@Controller('api/v1/courses')
export class CourseController {
  @Post()
  @ApiOperation({ summary: 'Create a new course' })
  @ApiResponse({ status: 201, type: CourseResponseDto })
  @ApiResponse({ status: 400, description: 'Validation error' })
  @ApiResponse({ status: 403, description: 'Insufficient permissions' })
  async create(@Body() dto: CreateCourseDto): Promise<CourseResponseDto> { ... }
}
```

## 8.12 DTO Conventions

| DTO Type | Naming Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Create | `Create{Resource}Dto` | Request body for POST |
| Update | `Update{Resource}Dto` | Request body for PUT/PATCH |
| Query | `{Resource}QueryDto` | Query parameters for GET list |
| Response | `{Resource}ResponseDto` | Response body |
| Nested | `{Resource}{Nested}Dto` | Nested object within another DTO |

**All response DTOs use explicit mapping** — entities are never returned directly. This prevents accidental exposure of internal fields.

```typescript
// course-response.dto.ts
export class CourseResponseDto {
  @ApiProperty({ example: 'uuid-here' })
  id: string;

  @ApiProperty({ example: 'Introduction to Algebra' })
  title: string;

  @ApiProperty({ example: 'topic_based' })
  format: CourseFormat;

  @ApiProperty({ example: 'published' })
  status: CourseStatus;

  // Computed fields
  @ApiProperty({ example: 42 })
  lessonCount: number;

  @ApiProperty({ example: 0.75 })
  completionRate?: number;  // Only present when requesting user's view

  @ApiProperty({ example: '2026-07-14T12:00:00Z' })
  createdAt: string;

  // Internal fields NOT exposed:
  // organization_id, created_by UUID, version, deleted_at
}
```

POST /api/v1/storage/upload-url
{
  "fileName": "homework_essay.pdf",
  "contentType": "application/pdf",
  "fileSize": 2048576,
  "context": "homework_submission",    // determines bucket and processing
  "metadata": {
    "homeworkId": "hw-uuid",
    "studentId": "student-uuid"
  }
}

// 2. Server responds with pre-signed URL
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/campusos-uploads-temp/...",
  "fileId": "file-uuid",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}

// 3. Client uploads directly to S3 using the pre-signed URL
// 4. Client confirms upload
POST /api/v1/storage/confirm-upload
{
  "fileId": "file-uuid"
}

// 5. Server triggers processing pipeline
```

# 10. Search Architecture

## 10.1 OpenSearch Design

### Index Configuration

| Index Name | Source Entity | Fields | Refresh Interval |
|------------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| `courses` | Course | title, description, tags, subject, level, format, status, org_id, branch_id | 5s |
| `lessons` | Lesson | title, description, content_text (extracted from blocks), course_id, module_id, org_id | 5s |
| `questions` | Question | text (extracted from content JSONB), category, tags, difficulty, type, org_id | 5s |
| `discussions` | Thread + Post | title, body, forum_id, course_id, author_name, org_id | 10s |
| `users` | User | first_name, last_name, email, role, branch_id, org_id | 30s |
| `resources` | ContentBlock | text_content (extracted), type, lesson_title, course_title, org_id | 10s |

### Index Mapping Example

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "standard",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": { "type": "keyword" },
          "autocomplete": {
            "type": "text",
            "analyzer": "autocomplete_analyzer"
          }
        }
      },
      "description": { "type": "text", "analyzer": "standard" },
      "tags": { "type": "keyword" },
      "subject": { "type": "keyword" },
      "status": { "type": "keyword" },
      "organization_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "branch_id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "created_at": { "type": "date" },
      "difficulty": { "type": "keyword" },
      "format": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "autocomplete_analyzer": {
          "type": "custom",
          "tokenizer": "autocomplete_tokenizer",
          "filter": ["lowercase"]
        }
      },
      "tokenizer": {
        "autocomplete_tokenizer": {
          "type": "edge_ngram",
          "min_gram": 2,
          "max_gram": 20,
          "token_chars": ["letter", "digit"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 10.2 Query Strategy

**Full-text search with tenant scoping:**

```typescript
// search.service.ts
async search(orgId: string, branchId: string, query: SearchQueryDto): Promise<SearchResultDto> {
  const body = {
    query: {
      bool: {
        must: [
          { multi_match: { query: query.q, fields: ['title^3', 'description^2', 'tags^1.5', 'content_text'] } }
        ],
        filter: [
          { term: { organization_id: orgId } },
          ...(branchId ? [{ term: { branch_id: branchId } }] : []),
          ...(query.filters?.status ? [{ term: { status: query.filters.status } }] : []),
          ...(query.filters?.subject ? [{ term: { subject: query.filters.subject } }] : []),
        ]
      }
    },
    aggs: {
      subjects: { terms: { field: 'subject', size: 20 } },
      difficulty: { terms: { field: 'difficulty', size: 5 } },
      formats: { terms: { field: 'format', size: 10 } }
    },
    highlight: {
      fields: { title: {}, description: {}, content_text: {} }
    },
    from: query.offset || 0,
    size: query.limit || 20
  };

  return this.opensearchClient.search({ index: query.index, body });
}
```

## 10.3 Autocomplete

Edge ngram tokenizer provides prefix-based suggestions:

```
GET /api/v1/search/autocomplete?q=alg&type=courses

Response:
{
  "suggestions": [
    { "text": "Algebra I", "type": "course", "id": "..." },
    { "text": "Algorithms and Data Structures", "type": "course", "id": "..." },
    { "text": "Algebraic Geometry", "type": "course", "id": "..." }
  ]
}
```

## 10.4 Faceted Search

Aggregations return available filter values with counts:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "facets": {
    "subjects": [
      { "key": "mathematics", "count": 45 },
      { "key": "physics", "count": 23 }
    ],
    "difficulty": [
      { "key": "beginner", "count": 30 },
      { "key": "intermediate", "count": 28 },
      { "key": "advanced", "count": 10 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 11.2 Video Transcoding

**Tool:** FFmpeg 6.x running in containerized workers

**Output profiles:**

| Profile | Resolution | Bitrate | Codec | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| 1080p | 1920x1080 | 5 Mbps | H.264/AAC | Full quality |
| 720p | 1280x720 | 2.5 Mbps | H.264/AAC | Standard quality |
| 480p | 854x480 | 1 Mbps | H.264/AAC | Low bandwidth |
| 360p | 640x360 | 500 Kbps | H.264/AAC | Mobile/slow connection |
| audio_only | N/A | 128 Kbps | AAC | Audio-only mode |

**HLS Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:**

```bash
# FFmpeg command for HLS transcoding
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
  -filter_complex "[0:v]split=4[v1][v2][v3][v4]; \
    [v1]scale=1920:1080[v1out]; \

  -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:0 v:2,a:0 v:3,a:0" \
  output_%v/stream.m3u8
```

## 11.3 Audio Processing

- **Normalization:** Loudness normalization to -16 LUFS
- **Format conversion:** All audio converted to AAC (.m4a) for universal playback
- **Waveform generation:** Visual waveform data (JSON) generated for audio player UI

## 11.4 Thumbnail Generation

| Source | Thumbnail Specs | Generation Method |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Video | 640x360 JPEG, quality 80 | FFmpeg frame extraction at 10% duration |
| Image | 300x300 JPEG, quality 75 (cover fit) | Sharp.js resize |
| PDF | 800x600 PNG of first page | pdf-to-img (Poppler) |
| Presentation | 800x600 PNG of first slide | LibreOffice headless conversion |

## 11.5 Queue Design

**Queue names and priority:**

| Queue | Priority | Concurrency | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `media:virus-scan` | High | 4 | Virus scanning (must complete before processing) |
| `media:video-transcode` | Normal | 2 per worker | Video transcoding (CPU-intensive) |
| `media:audio-process` | Normal | 4 per worker | Audio processing |
| `media:image-process` | Low | 8 per worker | Image resizing and optimization |
| `media:document-process` | Low | 4 per worker | Document preview generation |
| `media:thumbnail` | Low | 8 per worker | Thumbnail generation |

## 12.2 Provider Interface

```typescript
// speech-provider.interface.ts
export interface SpeechProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly capabilities: SpeechCapabilities;

  transcribe(audio: AudioInput, config: TranscribeConfig): Promise<TranscriptionResult>;

  assessPronunciation(
    audio: AudioInput,

  errorType: 'none' | 'mispronunciation' | 'omission' | 'insertion';
  startOffset: number;         // milliseconds

}
```

## 12.3 Pronunciation Scoring Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student as Student (Mobile)
    participant API as API Server
    participant GW as Speech Provider Gateway
    participant Provider as Speech Provider (Azure)
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant S3 as S3 Storage

    Student->>API: Upload audio recording
    API->>S3: Store recording (immutable for assessment mode)
    S3-->>API: File URL
    API->>DB: Create SpeechRecording record

    Student->>API: Request pronunciation assessment
    API->>GW: assessPronunciation(audioUrl, referenceText, config)
    GW->>GW: Resolve provider from tenant config
    GW->>Provider: Send audio + reference text
    Provider-->>GW: Raw scoring result
    GW->>GW: Normalize to standard PronunciationResult
    GW->>GW: Record usage (seconds, provider)
    GW-->>API: PronunciationResult

    API->>DB: Store PronunciationResult + WordScores
    API->>API: Publish PronunciationScored event

    alt Assessment Mode
        API->>API: Emit event → Gradebook records grade
    end

    API-->>Student: PronunciationResult with word highlights
```

## 12.4 Failover Strategy

1. Gateway attempts primary provider for tenant
2. On failure (HTTP error, timeout > 10s), falls back to next provider in priority chain
3. Fallback providers must support the same capability (e.g., pronunciation assessment)
4. If all providers fail, return 503 Service Unavailable with retry header
5. Provider health is checked every 60 seconds via health check endpoint
6. Degraded providers are temporarily removed from rotation for 5 minutes

## 12.5 Usage Metering

- Every provider call records: organization_id, provider, audio_duration_seconds, timestamp
- Usage aggregated hourly by background job
- Thresholds checked against organization's quota (from module license)
- Alert emitted at 80% and 95% of quota
- Service degraded (practice mode only) at 100% quota until reset or upgrade

## 12.6 Privacy and Retention

- Audio recordings for practice mode: retained for 7 days, then auto-deleted
- Audio recordings for assessment mode: retained for duration of enrollment + 1 year (immutable)
- Pronunciation scores: retained with gradebook data (same retention as grades)
- Audio is never shared across organizations
- S3 Object Lock used for assessment recordings (COMPLIANCE mode)

// llm-provider.interface.ts
export interface LLMProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly models: string[];

  chat(request: ChatRequest): Promise<ChatResponse>;
  chatStream(request: ChatRequest): AsyncIterable<ChatChunk>;

}

export interface ChatMessage {
  role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant' | 'tool';
  content: string;
  toolCallId?: string;
  toolCalls?: ToolCall[];
}
```

## 13.3 Prompt Management

- Prompts stored in PostgreSQL with version history
- Each prompt has: name, version, template (with variables), model, temperature, max_tokens
- Active version per prompt is cached in Redis (TTL: 5 min)
- A/B testing supported via prompt variants with traffic allocation

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_prompts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  template TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Handlebars template with {{variables}}
  variables JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]', -- Variable definitions with types
  model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  temperature DECIMAL(2,1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.7,
  max_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1000,
  version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

```

## 13.5 Tool Calling

Registered tools allow LLMs to query platform data:

```typescript
const tools: ToolDefinition[] = [
  {
    name: 'search_courses',
    description: 'Search for courses by keyword, subject, or level',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        query: { type: 'string', description: 'Search query' },
        subject: { type: 'string', description: 'Subject filter' },
      },
      required: ['query'],
    },
    handler: async (params) => courseSearchService.search(tenantContext, params),
  },
  {
    name: 'get_student_progress',
    description: 'Get a student\'s progress in a course',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        studentId: { type: 'string' },
        courseId: { type: 'string' },
      },
      required: ['studentId', 'courseId'],
    },
    handler: async (params) => completionService.getProgress(params.studentId, params.courseId),
  },
];
```

## 13.6 Content Moderation

- All user inputs to AI are screened for harmful content before LLM processing
- All LLM outputs are screened before returning to user
- Uses OpenAI Moderation API as primary filter
- Custom regex patterns for platform-specific prohibited content
- Moderation results logged for compliance review

## 13.7 AI Usage Logging

Every AI interaction is logged:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_usage_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  prompt_name VARCHAR(200),
  model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  input_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL,
  output_tokens INTEGER NOT NULL,
  latency_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'success', 'error', 'moderated'
  cost_usd DECIMAL(10,6),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

# 14. Security Architecture

## 14.0 Platform Super Admin Isolation

The `/platform/v1/...` API namespace (consumed exclusively by `apps/admin-desktop`, see §3.2.3.2) is treated as a separate trust boundary from the tenant-facing `/api/v1/...` namespace:

- Server-side guard rejects any request to `/platform/v1/...` unless the JWT carries the `platform_super_admin` role claim — enforced independently of, and in addition to, the client app's own login restriction.
- Recommended additional network-layer control: IP allowlist or VPN requirement at the WAF/load balancer for the `/platform/v1/...` path, since this traffic only ever originates from a small, known set of internal users.
- Every impersonation action taken through this surface writes to `AuditLog` with actor, target organization, target user, start/end timestamp, and reason; impersonation audit records are excluded from the standard soft-delete/purge retention policy (§7.4) and are retained indefinitely.

## 14.2 JWT Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Algorithm | RS256 (RSA-SHA256, asymmetric) |
| Key rotation | Automatic every 90 days, JWKS endpoint for verification |
| Token binding | Optional: bind access token to device fingerprint |
| Blacklisting | Redis-based blacklist for revoked tokens |
| Payload encryption | Sensitive claims encrypted with AES-256-GCM |
| JWKS endpoint | `/.well-known/jwks.json` for public key distribution |

## 14.3 MFA Implementation

**TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password):**
- Secret generated with `otpauth` library (160-bit secret)
- QR code generated for authenticator app enrollment
- 6-digit codes, 30-second window, ±1 window tolerance
- 10 backup codes generated on setup (bcrypt hashed, single-use)

**SMS-based MFA:**
- 6-digit code sent via SMS provider
- Code valid for 5 minutes
- Max 3 SMS codes per hour per user

## 14.4 Encryption

| Data Type | At Rest | In Transit |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Database | AES-256 (managed service encryption) | TLS 1.3 (PostgreSQL SSL) |
| Object Storage | AES-256-SSE (S3 server-side encryption) | TLS 1.3 (HTTPS) |
| Redis | Not encrypted (in VPC, no sensitive data stored as values) | TLS 1.2+ |
| API traffic | N/A | TLS 1.3 (required, no fallback) |
| Passwords | bcrypt (cost factor 12) | N/A (never stored plaintext) |
| MFA secrets | AES-256-GCM (application-level) | TLS 1.3 |
| API keys | SHA-256 hash stored, full key shown once | TLS 1.3 |

## 14.5 OWASP Top 10 Mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | RBAC + ABAC guards on every endpoint, RLS in PostgreSQL |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | TLS 1.3 everywhere, AES-256 at rest, no custom crypto |
| A03: Injection | Parameterized queries (TypeORM), input validation (class-validator) |
| A04: Insecure Design | Threat modeling in design phase, principle of least privilege |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | Hardened container images, security headers, no debug in prod |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | Automated dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot), weekly updates |
| A07: Auth Failures | JWT with RS256, refresh token rotation, MFA, account lockout |
| A08: Data Integrity Failures | Code signing, integrity checks on deployments, audit logs |
| A09: Logging Failures | Comprehensive audit logging, tamper-evident audit schema |
| A10: SSRF | URL validation, blocklist for internal IPs, no user-controlled URLs in server-side requests |

## 14.6 Security Headers

```typescript
// security-headers.middleware.ts
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],  // Required for some UI frameworks
      imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https://*.cloudfront.net'],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'", 'https://*.cloudfront.net'],

  frameguard: { action: 'deny' },
  referrerPolicy: { policy: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
}));
```

## 14.7 Exam Security

**Anti-cheat measures enforced server-side:**

| Measure | Client | Server |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Tab switch detection | Sends event | Logs violation, checks threshold |
| Window blur detection | Sends event | Logs violation |
| Full-screen exit | Detects, sends event | Logs violation |
| Clipboard monitoring | Detects copy/paste, sends event | Logs violation |
| Copy/paste restriction | Disables via JS | Validates no copy/paste in responses |
| Time enforcement | Client-side timer (display only) | **Server-side timer is authoritative** |
| Auto-submit on violations | N/A | Server triggers auto-submit at threshold |
| Webcam snapshots | Captures, uploads | Stores, available for proctor review |
| IP restrictions | N/A | Validates client IP against quiz config |
| Browser lockdown | Detects if in lockdown browser | Validates browser agent if required |

**Critical:** All anti-cheat decisions are made server-side. Client-side measures are defense-in-depth but the server is the authority.

## 14.8 File Scanning

- All uploaded files scanned by ClamAV before processing
- Scans run in isolated containers to prevent breakout
- Infected files quarantined in separate S3 bucket, original deleted
- Alert sent to ops team on any detection
- Scan results logged in audit trail

## 14.9 Secrets Management

- Application secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault
- No secrets in environment variables, config files, or source code
- JWT signing keys stored in secret manager with automatic rotation
- Database credentials rotated every 90 days
- API keys for external services managed centrally

# 15. Caching Strategy

## 15.1 Redis Architecture

**Deployment:** Redis 7+ Cluster (3 primaries, 3 replicas in production)

**Data Segregation:** Redis key prefixes isolate concerns:

```
auth:*          — Authentication (blacklist, sessions, rate limits)
rbac:*          — Permission cache
ff:*            — Feature flags
lms:*           — LMS data cache
assess:*        — Assessment active data
gradebook:*     — Grade summaries
gamify:*        — Leaderboards, streaks
search:*        — Search suggestions
media:*         — Media processing status
ai:*            — AI conversation history, prompt cache
notify:*        — Notification delivery status
schedule:*      — Calendar cache
msg:*           — Messaging unread counts
crm:*           — CRM pipeline cache
```

## 15.2 Cache Key Patterns

| Key Pattern | Data | TTL | Invalidation |
|-------------|------|-----|-------------|
| `auth:blacklist:{tokenHash}` | Revoked token marker | Token remaining TTL | N/A (auto-expires) |
| `auth:sessions:{userId}` | Active session IDs | 30 days | On logout/revocation |
| `auth:attempts:{ip}:{email}` | Login attempt count | 15 min | N/A (auto-expires) |
| `rbac:{userId}:permissions` | User permission set | 5 min | On role/permission change event |
| `ff:{orgId}:flags` | Feature flag state map | 60s | On feature flag toggle event |
| `lms:courses:{branchId}:list` | Course list page | 5 min | On course create/update/delete |
| `lms:course:{courseId}` | Full course detail | 10 min | On course update |
| `lms:progress:{userId}:{courseId}` | Completion progress | 2 min | On completion event |
| `assess:attempt:{attemptId}` | Active quiz attempt data | Quiz TTL + 10 min | On submit |
| `gradebook:summary:{studentId}:{courseId}` | Grade summary | 5 min | On grade change |
| `gamify:leaderboard:{scope}:{scopeId}` | Sorted set of scores | 5 min | On leaderboard recalculation |
| `gamify:streak:{userId}:{type}` | Current streak count | 1 day | On activity |
| `schedule:timetable:{branchId}:{week}` | Weekly timetable | 30 min | On schedule change |
| `msg:unread:{userId}` | Unread message count | N/A (updated in real-time) | On message read |

## 15.3 Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Event-driven invalidation (primary):**

```typescript
// cache-invalidation.event-handler.ts
@OnEvent('course.updated')
async handleCourseUpdated(event: CourseUpdatedEvent) {
  const course = await this.courseRepo.findById(event.courseId);

  await Promise.all([
    this.cache.del(`lms:course:${event.courseId}`),
    this.cache.del(`lms:courses:${course.branchId}:list`),
  ]);
}

@OnEvent('membership.changed')
async handleMembershipChanged(event: MembershipChangedEvent) {
  await this.cache.del(`rbac:${event.userId}:permissions`);
}
```

**Pattern-based invalidation:** For bulk operations (course import, bulk enrollment), use pattern-based deletion:

```typescript
// Delete all cached course lists for a branch
await this.cache.delPattern(`lms:courses:${branchId}:*`);
```

## 15.4 Distributed Locks

**Use Redlock algorithm** for operations requiring mutual exclusion:

| Lock | Purpose | TTL | Retry |
|------|---------|-----|-------|
| `lock:quiz:submit:{attemptId}` | Prevent double-submit of quiz | 30s | 3x, 100ms delay |
| `lock:grade:finalize:{courseId}` | Grade finalization (approval workflow) | 60s | 3x, 200ms delay |
| `lock:leaderboard:recalc:{scope}` | Leaderboard recalculation | 120s | No retry |
| `lock:enrollment:bulk:{operationId}` | Bulk enrollment | 300s | No retry |
| `lock:payment:process:{invoiceId}` | Payment processing | 60s | 3x, 100ms delay |
| `lock:export:{jobId}` | Content export | 600s | No retry |

## 15.5 Session Storage

**JWT-based sessions with Redis blacklist:**
- Sessions are stateless via JWT (no server-side session storage for request authentication)
- Redis stores only: token blacklist, active session metadata (for admin session listing), and rate limit counters
- This approach scales horizontally without sticky sessions

---

# 16. Background Jobs

## 16.1 Queue Architecture

**Technology:** BullMQ (Redis-backed job queue for Node.js)

**Queue topology:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Queues
        CRITICAL["Critical Queue (priority: 1)"]
        HIGH["High Queue (priority: 5)"]
        NORMAL["Normal Queue (priority: 10)"]
        LOW["Low Queue (priority: 20)"]
        SCHEDULED["Scheduled Queue (cron)"]
    end

    subgraph Workers ["Worker Pool"]
        W1["Worker 1 (critical + high)"]
        W2["Worker 2 (critical + high)"]
        W3["Worker 3 (normal)"]
        W4["Worker 4 (normal)"]
        W5["Worker 5 (low)"]
        W6["Worker 6 (media - dedicated)"]
        W7["Worker 7 (media - dedicated)"]
    end

    CRITICAL --> W1
    CRITICAL --> W2
    HIGH --> W1
    HIGH --> W2
    NORMAL --> W3
    NORMAL --> W4
    LOW --> W5
    SCHEDULED --> W3
```

## 16.2 Queue Definitions

| Queue Name | Priority | Concurrency | Job Types |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `critical` | 1 | 4 | Payment processing, grade recording, enrollment changes |
| `notifications` | 5 | 8 | Email, SMS, push, WhatsApp, Telegram dispatch |
| `assessment` | 5 | 4 | Auto-grading, quiz auto-submit, anti-cheat processing |
| `media` | 10 | 2 per worker | Video transcode, audio processing, thumbnail generation |
| `search` | 10 | 4 | OpenSearch indexing, bulk reindex |
| `analytics` | 15 | 4 | Aggregation computation, report generation |
| `export-import` | 15 | 2 | Content export, content import, bulk enrollment |
| `maintenance` | 20 | 2 | Session cleanup, temp file cleanup, old data archival |
| `webhooks` | 10 | 4 | Webhook delivery and retry |
| `gamification` | 10 | 4 | Badge evaluation, leaderboard recalculation, certificate generation |
| `ai` | 10 | 4 | Embedding generation, RAG indexing |
| `scheduled` | 10 | 2 | Cron jobs: reminders, digests, sync tasks |

## 16.3 Retry Strategy

```typescript
// Default retry config for BullMQ
const defaultJobOptions: JobsOptions = {
  attempts: 3,
  backoff: {
    type: 'exponential',
    delay: 1000,    // 1s, 2s, 4s
  },
  removeOnComplete: {
    age: 86400,     // Keep completed jobs for 24h
    count: 1000,    // Keep last 1000 completed
  },
  removeOnFail: false,  // Failed jobs stay for inspection
};

// Critical jobs get more retries
const criticalJobOptions: JobsOptions = {
  attempts: 5,
  backoff: {
    type: 'exponential',
    delay: 2000,    // 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s
  },
  removeOnFail: false,
};
```

## 16.4 Scheduled Jobs

| Job | Schedule | Priority | Description |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|
| Homework reminder | `0 */6 * * *` (every 6h) | Normal | Check for homework due within 24h, send reminders |
| Homework overdue check | `0 * * * *` (hourly) | Normal | Mark overdue homework, trigger notifications |
| Streak check | `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM) | Low | Check and break inactive streaks |
| Leaderboard recalculation | `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 min) | Low | Recalculate all active leaderboards |
| Digest compilation | `0 8 * * *` (daily at 8 AM) | Normal | Compile and send daily notification digests |
| Calendar sync | `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 min) | Low | Sync with Google/Microsoft calendars |
| Usage aggregation | `0 */1 * * *` (hourly) | Low | Aggregate speech/AI usage for billing |
| Session cleanup | `0 3 * * *` (daily at 3 AM) | Low | Remove expired sessions from database |
| Temp file cleanup | `0 4 * * *` (daily at 4 AM) | Low | Delete expired temp uploads from S3 |
| Audit archival | `0 5 * * 0` (weekly Sunday 5 AM) | Low | Archive old audit logs to cold storage |
| Backup verification | `0 6 * * 1` (weekly Monday 6 AM) | Low | Restore backup to staging, verify |
| Follow-up reminders | `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays 9 AM) | Normal | CRM follow-up reminders |
| Payment reminders | `0 10 * * *` (daily 10 AM) | High | Payment due/overdue reminders |
| Recurring payments | `0 0 * * *` (daily midnight) | Critical | Process scheduled recurring payments |
| Analytics aggregation | `0 1 * * *` (daily 1 AM) | Low | Compute daily analytics aggregates |

## 16.5 Dead Letter Queue Handling

When a job exhausts all retries:
1. Job moved to DLQ (separate BullMQ queue: `{queueName}-dlq`)
2. Alert sent to monitoring channel (Slack/PagerDuty based on priority)
3. DLQ jobs inspectable via admin dashboard
4. Manual retry available with modified parameters
5. DLQ depth monitored, alerts at thresholds (see §6.4)

---

# 17. Integration Architecture

## 17.1 Integration Pattern

All external integrations follow the **Adapter Pattern**:

```typescript
// Generic integration interface
interface IntegrationAdapter<TConfig, TResult> {
  readonly name: string;
  initialize(config: TConfig): Promise<void>;
  healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>;
  execute(request: unknown): Promise<TResult>;
}
```

Each integration category has:
1. **Abstract interface** defining the contract
2. **Multiple adapter implementations** (one per provider)
3. **Factory** for adapter selection based on tenant configuration
4. **Fallback chain** for critical integrations

## 17.2 Payment Integrations

| Provider | Adapter | Capabilities |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Stripe | `StripePaymentAdapter` | Cards, bank transfer, recurring, refunds |
| PayPal | `PayPalPaymentAdapter` | PayPal balance, cards, refunds |
| Payme (UZ) | `PaymePaymentAdapter` | Local payment (Uzbekistan) |
| Click (UZ) | `ClickPaymentAdapter` | Local payment (Uzbekistan) |

```typescript
// payment-gateway.interface.ts
export interface PaymentGateway {
  createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string, metadata: Record<string, string>): Promise<PaymentIntent>;
  confirmPayment(intentId: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refund(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult>;
  createSubscription(customerId: string, planId: string): Promise<SubscriptionResult>;
  handleWebhook(payload: Buffer, signature: string): Promise<WebhookEvent>;
}
```

## 17.3 Email Integration

**Provider:** AWS SES (primary), SendGrid (fallback)

- Template-based emails with Handlebars templates
- Bounce and complaint handling via SNS webhooks
- Email verification for new accounts
- Rate limiting: 50 emails/second per tenant
- Unsubscribe links mandatory (CAN-SPAM compliance)

## 17.4 SMS Integration

**Provider:** Twilio (primary)

- Template-based SMS with variable substitution
- Delivery status tracking via Twilio webhooks
- Usage-based billing per tenant (credits system)
- Country-specific routing rules
- Opt-out management (STOP keyword handling)

## 17.5 WhatsApp Integration

**Provider:** WhatsApp Business API (via Meta Cloud API)

- Template messages for notifications (pre-approved by WhatsApp)
- Session messages for conversations
- Media message support (images, documents)
- Delivery and read receipts

## 17.6 Telegram Integration

**Provider:** Telegram Bot API

- Bot per organization (optional)
- Notification delivery as Telegram messages
- Deep links to platform content
- Inline keyboard for quick actions

## 17.7 Calendar Integration

**Providers:** Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph Calendar API

```typescript
// calendar-sync.interface.ts
export interface CalendarProvider {
  authorize(redirectUrl: string): string;
  handleCallback(code: string): Promise<CalendarTokens>;
  listEvents(calendarId: string, timeMin: Date, timeMax: Date): Promise<CalendarEvent[]>;
  createEvent(calendarId: string, event: CalendarEventInput): Promise<CalendarEvent>;
  updateEvent(calendarId: string, eventId: string, event: Partial<CalendarEventInput>): Promise<CalendarEvent>;
  deleteEvent(calendarId: string, eventId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Sync strategy:**
- Bidirectional sync every 15 minutes (configurable)
- Webhook-based real-time sync (Google Push Notifications / Microsoft Graph subscriptions)
- Conflict resolution: platform is source of truth; external changes create notifications for user review

## 17.8 SSO / LDAP / SAML

**SSO Providers:**
- Google Workspace (OAuth 2.0)
- Microsoft Azure AD (OAuth 2.0 / SAML 2.0)
- Okta (SAML 2.0)
- Generic SAML 2.0 IdP
- Generic LDAP/LDAPS directory

**SAML flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SP as CampusOS (Service Provider)
    participant IdP as Identity Provider

    User->>SP: Access login page
    SP->>SP: Generate SAML AuthnRequest
    SP->>IdP: Redirect with AuthnRequest
    IdP->>User: Login form
    User->>IdP: Submit credentials
    IdP->>IdP: Authenticate, create SAML Assertion
    IdP->>SP: POST /auth/saml/callback with SAMLResponse
    SP->>SP: Validate signature, extract attributes
    SP->>SP: Create/update user, issue JWT
    SP->>User: Redirect to dashboard with JWT
```

# 18. Scalability Strategy

## 18.1 Horizontal Scaling

### Application Tier

```mermaid
graph TB
    LB["Load Balancer (ALB)"] --> APP1["App Instance 1"]
    LB --> APP2["App Instance 2"]
    LB --> APP3["App Instance 3"]
    LB --> APPN["App Instance N"]

    APP1 --> PG_POOL["PgBouncer Connection Pool"]
    APP2 --> PG_POOL
    APP3 --> PG_POOL
    APPN --> PG_POOL

    PG_POOL --> PG_PRIMARY["PostgreSQL Primary"]
    PG_POOL --> PG_REPLICA1["PostgreSQL Replica 1"]
    PG_POOL --> PG_REPLICA2["PostgreSQL Replica 2"]

    APP1 --> REDIS["Redis Cluster"]
    APP2 --> REDIS
    APP3 --> REDIS
    APPN --> REDIS
```

**Stateless application design:**
- No server-side sessions (JWT-based)
- No local file storage (S3 for all files)
- No in-memory caches beyond Redis
- WebSocket connections use Redis adapter for multi-instance pub/sub
- Any instance can handle any request

**Auto-scaling policy:**
- Scale up: CPU > 70% for 3 minutes OR memory > 80% for 3 minutes
- Scale down: CPU < 30% for 10 minutes AND memory < 50% for 10 minutes
- Min instances: 3 (production), 1 (staging)
- Max instances: 20 (adjustable)

## 18.2 Database Scaling

### Connection Pooling

**PgBouncer** sits between application instances and PostgreSQL:
- Pool mode: Transaction (default), Session (for LISTEN/NOTIFY)
- Max connections per pool: 100
- Default pool size: 20 per application instance
- Reserve pool: 5 connections for admin operations

### Read Replicas

- 2 read replicas in production
- Reads routed to replicas: analytics queries, search indexing, report generation, dashboard data
- Writes always go to primary
- Replication lag monitoring: alert if > 5 seconds

```typescript
// TypeORM configuration for read replicas
TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
  type: 'postgres',
  replication: {
    master: { host: 'pg-primary', port: 5432, username: '...', password: '...', database: 'campusos' },
    slaves: [
      { host: 'pg-replica-1', port: 5432, username: '...', password: '...', database: 'campusos' },
      { host: 'pg-replica-2', port: 5432, username: '...', password: '...', database: 'campusos' },
    ],
  },
});
```

## 18.3 Future Microservice Extraction

**Extraction Priority (when operational pressure justifies it):**

| Priority | Module | Trigger | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Auth | Token validation becomes bottleneck | Independent scaling, security isolation |
| 2 | Assessment Engine | Concurrent exam load spikes | Independent scaling during exam periods |
| 3 | Media Pipeline | Already isolated workers | Fully independent lifecycle |
| 4 | AI Gateway | Usage patterns differ from CRUD | Independent scaling, cost optimization |
| 5 | Notifications | High fanout during bulk operations | Independent scaling |
| 6 | Search | Index operations impact API latency | Isolation from core API |

**Extraction strategy:**
1. Module already has clear service interfaces (enforced by module boundary rules)
2. Extract module into independent NestJS application
3. Replace in-process service calls with REST/gRPC + events
4. Each extracted service gets its own database (where data isolation justifies it)
5. Shared data accessed via events (eventually consistent) or lightweight REST
6. Deploy as independent Kubernetes Deployment with its own HPA

## 18.4 CDN Strategy

| Content Type | CDN Caching | Cache Duration |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Static assets (JS, CSS, fonts) | Edge cached | 1 year (versioned filenames) |
| Media (video, audio, images) | Edge cached | 30 days |
| API responses | Not cached at CDN | N/A (dynamic) |
| Public pages (website builder) | Edge cached | 5 minutes |
| Certificates (verification) | Edge cached | 1 hour |

    ALERTS --> EMAIL_ALERT["Email"]

    APP -->|"Errors"| SENTRY["Sentry"]
```

## 19.2 Logging

**Structured JSON logging** via `pino` (NestJS native logger):

```typescript
// Log format
{
  "level": "info",
  "time": "2026-07-14T12:00:00.000Z",
  "msg": "Course created",
  "traceId": "abc123",
  "spanId": "def456",
  "organizationId": "org-uuid",
  "userId": "user-uuid",
  "resourceType": "course",
  "resourceId": "course-uuid",
  "duration": 45,
  "service": "lms"
}
```

**Log levels:**
- `error`: Application errors requiring attention
- `warn`: Unexpected conditions that don't prevent operation
- `info`: Business events (course created, payment received)
- `debug`: Technical details (query plans, cache hits/misses)
- `trace`: Detailed tracing (disabled in production)

## 19.3 Metrics

**Key metrics exported via OpenTelemetry:**

| Metric | Type | Labels | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| `http_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | method, route, status | p95 > 300ms |
| `http_requests_total` | Counter | method, route, status | Error rate > 1% |
| `db_query_duration_seconds` | Histogram | operation, table | p95 > 100ms |
| `redis_operation_duration_seconds` | Histogram | operation | p95 > 10ms |
| `queue_job_duration_seconds` | Histogram | queue, job_type | Varies by queue |
| `queue_depth` | Gauge | queue | > 1000 (non-media) |
| `active_websocket_connections` | Gauge | — | > 10,000 |
| `auth_login_attempts_total` | Counter | method, status | Failed > 100/min |
| `search_query_duration_seconds` | Histogram | index | p95 > 500ms |
| `media_transcode_duration_seconds` | Histogram | profile | > 10min for 720p |
| `speech_provider_latency_seconds` | Histogram | provider | p95 > 5s |
| `ai_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | model, prompt | p95 > 10s |
| `tenant_storage_bytes` | Gauge | organization_id | > quota |

## 19.4 Health Checks

```
GET /health              → 200 OK (basic liveness)
GET /health/ready        → 200 OK if all dependencies healthy
GET /health/detailed     → 200 OK with dependency status (admin only)
```

**Detailed health response:**

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": 86400,
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "dependencies": {
    "postgresql": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 2 },
    "redis": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 1 },
    "opensearch": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 5 },
    "s3": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 15 },
    "bullmq": { "status": "healthy", "queued": 42 }
  }
}
```

## 19.5 Dashboards

| Dashboard | Purpose | Key Panels |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Platform Overview | High-level health | Request rate, error rate, latency p50/p95/p99, active users |
| API Performance | Endpoint-level metrics | Slowest endpoints, error rates by endpoint, request distribution |
| Database | PostgreSQL health | Query latency, connections, replication lag, table sizes |
| Queue Health | BullMQ monitoring | Queue depth, processing rate, failed jobs, DLQ depth |
| Tenant Dashboard | Per-tenant metrics | Storage usage, API calls, user counts, module usage |
| Media Pipeline | Media processing | Transcode queue, processing time, failure rate |
| Auth & Security | Security monitoring | Login attempts, MFA usage, suspicious activity |
| AI Usage | AI feature monitoring | Token usage, latency, costs, moderation flags |

# 20. Disaster Recovery

## 20.1 Backup Strategy

| Component | RPO | RTO | Method |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|
| PostgreSQL (primary) | 1 hour | 4 hours | WAL archiving + daily full backup |
| PostgreSQL (audit schema) | 1 hour | 8 hours | Separate backup stream, 7-year retention |
| Redis | N/A (reconstructable) | 15 minutes | RDB snapshots every 15 min, AOF enabled |
| S3 Objects | 0 (durable) | 0 (available) | Cross-region replication enabled |
| OpenSearch | N/A (reconstructable) | 2 hours | Snapshot to S3 daily, full reindex as fallback |
| Configuration | 0 | 30 minutes | Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), version controlled |

## 20.2 Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

```
1. Identify failure type (corruption, data loss, accidental deletion)
2. If point-in-time recovery needed:
   a. Restore latest base backup
   b. Replay WAL logs to target timestamp
   c. Validate data integrity
   d. Update application connection strings
3. If full restore needed:
   a. Provision new PostgreSQL instance from latest full backup
   b. Apply WAL replay
   c. Verify RLS policies
   d. Run data integrity checks
   e. Switch DNS to new instance
```

### Application Recovery

```
1. If application failure:
   a. Kubernetes auto-restarts pods (restartPolicy: Always)
   b. If persistent failure: rollback to previous deployment
   c. Argo Rollouts supports one-click rollback
2. If infrastructure failure:
   a. Kubernetes reschedules pods to healthy nodes
   b. If zone failure: multi-AZ deployment ensures availability
```

## 20.3 RPO / RTO Targets

| Tier | RPO | RTO | Scope |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Standard | 1 hour | 4 hours | All non-enterprise tenants |
| Enterprise | 15 minutes | 1 hour | Enterprise-tier tenants with SLA |
| Critical data (grades, payments) | 0 (synchronous replication) | 30 minutes | Specific tables |

## 20.4 Deployment Rollback

**Argo Rollouts Blue/Green deployment:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    LB["Load Balancer"] -->|"100% traffic"| BLUE["Blue (v1.2.2 - current)"]
    LB -.->|"0% traffic"| GREEN["Green (v1.2.3 - new)"]

    GREEN -->|"Health checks pass"| PROMOTE["Promote: shift traffic"]
    GREEN -->|"Health checks fail"| ROLLBACK["Auto-rollback: stay on Blue"]

    PROMOTE --> LB2["Load Balancer"]
    LB2 -->|"100% traffic"| GREEN2["Green (v1.2.3 - promoted)"]
```

- Health checks run for 5 minutes after deploy
- Automatic rollback if: error rate > 5%, p95 latency > 1s, health check failures
- Manual rollback available via `kubectl argo rollouts undo`
- Database migrations are forward-only; rollback requires separate migration

## 21.2 Package Manager

**Choice:** pnpm with workspaces

**Rationale:** pnpm is faster than npm/yarn for monorepos, uses hard links to save disk space, and has strict dependency resolution that prevents phantom dependencies.

## 21.3 Build System

**Choice:** Turborepo

**Rationale:** Turborepo provides incremental builds, remote caching, and task orchestration across workspace packages. It understands dependency graphs and only rebuilds what changed.

```json
// turbo.json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    },
    "lint": {},
    "type-check": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 22.2 Key Tradeoff Decisions

### Why Modular Monolith Over Microservices

**Decision:** Start as modular monolith, extract microservices when justified.

**Tradeoffs:**

| Factor | Monolith (Chosen) | Microservices |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Development speed | ✅ Fast — single repo, single deploy | ❌ Slower — service boundaries, API contracts |
| Debugging | ✅ Single process, stack traces | ❌ Distributed tracing required |
| Data consistency | ✅ ACID transactions across modules | ❌ Eventual consistency, saga patterns |
| Operational cost | ✅ Single deployment | ❌ N deployments, service mesh, discovery |
| Team coordination | ✅ Easier for < 30 engineers | ❌ Required for 50+ engineers |
| Scalability | ⚠️ Scale entire app | ✅ Scale individual services |
| Fault isolation | ⚠️ Bug affects entire app | ✅ Blast radius limited to service |

**Migration path:** Module boundaries are enforced via DI and event-driven communication. When a module needs independent scaling (e.g., Assessment during exam periods), extract it by:
1. Moving the module to its own NestJS application
2. Replacing in-process service calls with REST/gRPC
3. Giving it its own database (if needed)
4. Connecting via Redis Streams for events

### Why Redis Streams Over Kafka

**Decision:** Use Redis Streams for event durability.

**Tradeoffs:**

| Factor | Redis Streams (Chosen) | Kafka |

| Operational complexity | ✅ Already running Redis | ❌ Separate cluster to manage |
| Consumer groups | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Message ordering | ✅ Per-stream | ✅ Per-partition |
| Message retention | ⚠️ Memory-bound (configurable) | ✅ Disk-based, unlimited |
| Throughput | ⚠️ 100K msg/s | ✅ 1M+ msg/s |
| Replay capability | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Cost | ✅ No additional cost | ❌ Kafka cluster cost |

**Migration path:** If throughput exceeds Redis Streams capacity (unlikely before 50K+ concurrent users), migrate to Kafka. The event publishing interface (`EventBus.publish()`) is abstracted — switching the backing transport requires only changing the infrastructure adapter.

### Why TypeORM Over Prisma

**Decision:** Use TypeORM as the ORM.

**Tradeoffs:**

| Factor | TypeORM (Chosen) | Prisma |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| NestJS integration | ✅ First-class | ⚠️ Requires manual setup |
| Decorator entities | ✅ Decorators match NestJS style | ❌ Schema file (separate DSL) |
| Raw SQL | ✅ Easy escape hatch | ⚠️ Requires `$queryRaw` |
| Migrations | ✅ Auto-generate from entities | ✅ Better migration UX |
| RLS support | ✅ SET LOCAL via QueryRunner | ⚠️ Requires middleware hack |
| Performance | ⚠️ Slightly slower | ✅ Rust query engine |
| Type safety | ⚠️ Runtime decorators | ✅ Generated client, full type safety |

```

## 23.2 Extraction Playbook

For each module extraction:

1. **Verify module boundaries:** Ensure no cross-module repository access, no shared database transactions
2. **Create service interface:** Define REST/gRPC API contract for the module
3. **Implement dual-mode:** Module works both in-process (monolith) and as standalone service
4. **Deploy shadow service:** Run extracted service in parallel, comparing results
5. **Cut over:** Route traffic to extracted service, decommission monolith module
6. **Separate database:** If needed, migrate module tables to independent database

## 23.3 Future Technology Considerations

| Technology | Use Case | When to Adopt |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Kafka | Event streaming | When Redis Streams throughput insufficient (> 100K events/sec) |
| GraphQL | API gateway | When mobile app needs flexible queries (reduce over-fetching) |
| gRPC | Inter-service communication | When extracting microservices (Phase 2+) |
| Kubernetes Service Mesh (Istio) | Service-to-service security, observability | Phase 3+ with multiple services |
| Multi-region deployment | Geographic distribution | Enterprise tier with latency requirements |
| Apache Flink | Stream processing | Real-time analytics at scale |
| Temporal | Workflow orchestration | Complex multi-step workflows (enrollment, content import) |

## 23.4 API Evolution

When the platform grows beyond REST API capacity:

1. **GraphQL Federation:** Add Apollo Gateway as a unified API layer that federates queries across microservices
2. **WebSocket API:** Formalize WebSocket events into a documented real-time API
3. **Webhook API v2:** Add webhook filtering, transformation, and batching
4. **Public SDK:** Generate and publish client SDKs (TypeScript, Python, Go) from OpenAPI spec

## 23.5 Data Evolution

| Current | Future | Trigger |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Single PostgreSQL | Sharded PostgreSQL (by organization_id) | > 5TB database size |
| OpenSearch for search | Dedicated analytics database (ClickHouse) | Complex real-time analytics |
| pgvector for embeddings | Dedicated vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) | > 100M vectors |
| Redis Streams for events | Kafka + Schema Registry | Event schema evolution at scale |
